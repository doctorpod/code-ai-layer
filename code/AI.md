## Workflows

Workflows live in `_AI/local/workflows/` (code-specific) and `_AI/shared/workflows/` (shared). When the user's request matches a trigger below, read and follow the corresponding workflow file.

> **Fresh context warning:** before starting any workflow marked ⚠️, check whether this session already contains PRP creation work or implementation work. If it does, stop and tell the user to start a new session before proceeding.

The user has asked you to "save"

1. Create a brief summary of what you have just done, no more than 12 words
2. Run `bash _AI/local/scripts/save.sh "<your brief summary>"`
3. Run `bash _AI/local/scripts/log-write.sh "COMMIT: <your brief summary>"`

Do not inspect git status, second-guess what the scripts stage, or try to manage the commit yourself. The scripts handle everything. Just run them.
